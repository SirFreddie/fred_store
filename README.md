# Fred Store

This is a store system I created using a bunch of code from others scripts already made (vorp_fence, vorp_vendor, etc, etc). 
With this you can create stores where the player can buy or sell items. You can categorize your items for a more organized way to buy/sell. You can also choose wich currency to use (money, gold, rol). This could be use as a base not only for stores but for a bunch of other things like weapon shops, VIP stores, saloons, etc.

If you don't know how to create more sub menus or to add new items just use my code as a reference (that's what i did).

This is a RedM resource made for VORP Framework.
